## Key Features & Implementation

### Responsive Design

The application is built with a mobile-first approach.
* **On screens smaller than 768px**, records are displayed as individual cards for optimal readability and touch interaction.
* **On screens larger than 768px**, the layout switches to a traditional table view to make use of the wider screen space.

### Regex Validation Catalog

The "Add/Edit Record" form uses the following regular expressions for robust input validation:

| Field         | Regex Pattern                  | Purpose                                        |
| :------------ | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Description** | `^\S(?:.*\S)?$`                | Ensures the field is not empty or just whitespace. |
| **Amount** | `^(0|[1-9]\d*)(\.\d{1,2})?$`    | Validates a positive number with up to 2 decimals. |
| **Category** | `^[A-Za-z]+(?:[ -][A-Za-z]+)*$` | Allows letters, spaces, and hyphens for category names. |
| **Duplicate Word**| `\b(\w+)\s+\1\b`                 | An advanced check to catch accidental repeated words. |

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Accessibility was a key focus during development. The application includes:
* **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>` landmarks.
* **Keyboard Navigation:** The entire application is fully navigable using only the keyboard (`Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Enter`).
* **Visible Focus States:** All interactive elements have a clear and consistent focus ring.
* **Form Labels:** All form inputs are properly linked to their corresponding labels for screen reader compatibility.
* **Skip Link:** A "Skip to main content" link is the first focusable element for users who want to bypass the navigation.

### Keyboard Navigation Map

* **`Tab`**: Move focus forward to the next interactive element.
* **`Shift + Tab`**: Move focus backward.
* **`Enter`**: Activate a focused button or submit a form.
